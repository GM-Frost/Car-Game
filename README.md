### Description
This is a 2D Car Game created using Pygame, a Python library for game development. The objective of the game is to drive a car and score points by passing red cars. As the game progresses, the speed of the cars coming from the opposite direction increases, and the game level increases based on the speed. The game also includes a retry button to restart the game from the beginning, and a music player with mute and unmute buttons.

The game is controlled using the A and D keys or the Left/Right Arrow keys on the keyboard.
